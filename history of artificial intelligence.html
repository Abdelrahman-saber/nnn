The term artificial intelligence was coined in 1956, but AI has become more popular today thanks toincreased data volumes, 
advanced algorithms, and improvements in computing power and storage.
Early AI research in the 1950s explored topics like problem solving and symbolic methods. 
In the 1960s, the US Department of Defense took interest in this type of work and began training computers 
to mimic basic human reasoning. For example, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) completed 
street mapping projects in the 1970s. And DARPA produced intelligent personal assistants in 2003, long before
 Siri, Alexa or Cortana were household names.
This early work paved the way for the automation and formal reasoning that we see in computers today, including
 decision support systems and smart search systems that can be designed to complement and augment human abilities.
While Hollywood movies and science fiction novels depict AI as human-like robots that take over the world, the current
 evolution of AI technologies isnâ€™t that scary  or quite that smart. Instead, AI has evolved to provide many specific
 benefits in every industry. Keep reading for modern examples of artificial intelligence in health care, retail and more.
